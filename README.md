# AudioByte - Serverless Music Streaming Platform, Upload and stream

A full stack cloud music streaming web-app built using AWS services. Includes user authentication, file uploads, and real time streaming.

# Architecture

It consists of react frontend that connects and interacts with an AppSync GraphQL API secured by an authentication token provided from Cognito authentication. When users login and interact with the application, requests now go through AppSync to specialized Lambda functions for uploading, listing, and deleting songs. The lambda functions interact with the DynamoDB to store and retrieve metadata, while the song files are stored in the s3 Bucket with presigned URLS for secure access. All components are monitored through Cloud watch dasboards that track invocations from lambda, API errors, storage metrics and database performance.
